## TL,DR
This theme takes [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) syntax highlighting while using the increasingly popular [Catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palette. A bit of added personal flair as well and color scheme is tuned for python. Enjoy!

## Description
I absolutely love the syntax highlighting in the [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) theme by Liviu Schera, but [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) is absolutely blowing up right now and it is such a nice palette, I had to try to combine the two. This is the result!

**Enjoy!**
